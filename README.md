0X00 AirBnB console

This project focuses on building a console for an AirBnB web application and starts from the back end moving forward, by first setting up the console, and then progressing on to the class for all other objects that will follow.

-To start it, hit './console' to get it running
-To use it, simply run the programme then there'll be options to either remove or update people to our system and also store information in a json file to be able to re-read the previous sessions data

e.g if you enter 'quit', the program should seize executions
